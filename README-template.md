## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Responsive design

### What I learned

In this project I was very familiar with most of the concepts but I did learn about using relative units in order to create a more responsive final product. Units like px have some limitations when your screen size changes. In this project I used relative units like % and rem.

### Continued development

In the future I hope to learn more about responsive design and use media queries more effectively. I also want to try my hand at designing a project using a mobile first approach.
